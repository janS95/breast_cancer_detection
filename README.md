# Breast Cancer detection

* Read breast cancer data which includes features as mean radius, mean area, texture, etc. The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
* The target is either M (malicious) or B (benign)
* Scaled the dataset with StandardScaler()
* Trained a Logistic Regression Model
* Evaluation showed a accuracy of about 97 %
